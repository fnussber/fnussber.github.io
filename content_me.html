                I am a Swiss citizen currently working in the US for <a href="http://www.gemini.edu">Gemini Observatory</a>,
                an international astronomical observatory on top of Mauna Kea on Hawai'i.

            <h3>Multifunctional</h3>

            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a pragmatic generalist that tries to provide solid, working solutions that reflect
                the needs of the users and are easy to use and maintain.
            </p>

            <h3>When Working</h3>

            <p>
                I love direct interaction with the customers and believe it is essential to engage future
                users from start to end in the analysis and development process of software to minimize risks and maximize
                the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like international environments and team work and I am a big fan of agile development processes
                and have made good experiences with Scrum in the past.
            </p>

            <h3>When Not Working</h3>

            <p>
                In my spare time I can be found <a href="http://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/padi-courses/course-catalog/rescue-diver/">scuba diving</a>,
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_R1200GS">motorbiking</a>, hiking, running, cycling, trying to swim (not my best discipline),
                do all of the previous three in <a href="http://www.lavamantriathlon.com/waikoloa/">short succession</a>,
                vegging at home, reading a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four">good book</a>, eating in a restaurant or walking my dog.
